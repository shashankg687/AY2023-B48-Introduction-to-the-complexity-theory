# AY2023-B48-Introduction-to-the-complexity-theory

This repository contains the course materials for AY2023-B48-Introduction-to-the-complexity-theory, a course offered by the Prof. Ulff Dieckmann at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology.

## Course description

This course introduces the basic concepts and techniques of computational complexity theory, which studies the inherent difficulty of computational problems and the resources required to solve them. The topics covered include:

- Models of computation: Turing machines, circuits, Boolean formulas, decision trees, etc.
- Time complexity: deterministic and nondeterministic time, polynomial-time reductions, NP-completeness, hierarchy theorems, time-space tradeoffs, etc.
- Space complexity: deterministic and nondeterministic space, Savitch's theorem, PSPACE-completeness, L and NL classes, Immerman-Szelepcs√©nyi theorem, etc.
- Circuit complexity: circuit families, uniformity, circuit lower bounds, circuit satisfiability, etc.
- Randomized complexity: probabilistic Turing machines, BPP and RP classes, randomized reductions, derandomization techniques, etc.

## Course objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Understand the fundamental concepts and results of computational complexity theory
- Analyze the complexity of various computational problems and prove their hardness or easiness
- Apply complexity techniques to other areas of computer science and mathematics
- Appreciate the beauty and depth of complexity theory and its open questions

## Course prerequisites

Students are expected to have a solid background in discrete mathematics, logic, and algorithms. Familiarity with basic concepts of automata theory and computability theory is helpful but not required.

## Course materials

The course materials include lecture notes, slides, homework assignments, solutions, and references. They are organized in folders according to the topics covered in each lecture. The main textbook for this course is:
