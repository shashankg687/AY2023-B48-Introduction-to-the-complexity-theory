1. Set mode and variant categories separated, allowing Mandelbrot and Julia modes for each variation Standard, Burning Ship and Tricorn. Julias mapped from the Burning Ship's 'keel' are particularly attractive.
2. Linear color interpolation added to colormap rendering, producing much smoother color gradients.
3. Periodicity checking added to fractal calculation routine, dramatically improving rendering times for plots
which feature substantial 'in set' (black) points.

1. Fixed bug in `mandelpycli` command line utility that was skewing the zyoffset coordinate. Also minor improvements to metadata import.

header element from `mandelpy` to `pymandel` - see examples in `images` folder.

### RELEASE 1.0.3

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Console script entry point added to `setup.py`, so application can now be launched via a simple `pymandel` command as an alternative to `python -m pymandel`, provided the Python 3 scripts/bin folder is in the user's PATH.
